# VSCode-ConfigSnippets

These are small examples that are easily added to your User.js mini VS Code config files by topic, instead of dumping an entire user.js profile

## Location of Settings.json

`%AppData%\Code\User\settings.json`

## util: collect settings

`util\collect vscode settings.ps1` generates the `exported\*.json` configs
